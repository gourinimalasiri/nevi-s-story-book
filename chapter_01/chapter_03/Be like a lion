Be like a lion

Sometimes things will cause you fear. Like standing up for a friend, petting your neighbors dog, or speaking to a police officer. All of these things are good, and it would be a shame to miss them. When you feel fear be like a lion. Lions are brave and courageous. Strong and bold. Hold your head up high and speak loud. Roar like a lion. Let your voice be heard. When you feel fear know that you are not alone. Every lion has a pride. A team to help them. Fear will come and go. It won't last forever, but the lion inside you will.
