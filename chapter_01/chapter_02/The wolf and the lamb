The wolf and the lamb
One day, A lamb was eating sweet grass | away from her flock of sheep. She didn't notice a wolf walking nearer to her. When she saw the wolf, she started pleading, "Please, don't eat me. My stomach is full | of grass. You can wait a while to make my meat taste much better. The grass in my stomach will be digested quickly if you let | me dance." The wolf agreed.
While the lamb was dancing, she had a | new idea. She said, "I can dance faster if I you take my bell and ring it so hard." The wolf took the bell and started to ring I so hard. The shepherd heard the sound I and ran quickly to save the lamb's life.
