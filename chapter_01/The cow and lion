The cows and the lions
Five cows lived in a little forest. They ate fresh grass in a large green meadow. They were kind friends. They decided to do everything together, so the lions couldn't attack them for food.
One day, the five cows fought and each one started to eat grass in a different place. The lions decided to seize the opportunity and killed them one by one.
